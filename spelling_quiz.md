In this first I have downloaded the zip file and saw there are 2 text files and a python file.
I didnt go into the python file but went into flag.txt and i entered the command "cat flag.txt" and a random text appreared.
next i opened study-guide.txt and i saw there are some random letters in the file.
So i went to google and clicked cipher analyzer and then i went into the first website and then pasted all the letters from study-guide.txt
And then after pasting the letters i clicked on analyze text.
Then it said the cipher text can be a mono-alphabetic substitution cipher.
then i clicked on it and then went to the cipher tool.
there i pasted all the cipher letters from the study-guide.txt and then i clicked auto solve
i saw few letters making sense, then i pasted the cipher text from flag.txt as well into the bunch of cipher texts and clicked on auto solve.
then a text appeared which made sense, i copied it and pasted it in the answer and it was correct.
the flag is:- picoCTF{perhaps_the_dog_jumped_over_was_just_tired}
